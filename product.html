				<strong>
					Global use of Video Assistant Referee 
				</strong>
			</p>
			<p>		
				VAR stands for Video Assistant Referee. Its goal-line technology which was introduced in football to help determine if the ball crossed the line of the 
                goal or not. Before the VAR was introduced you only had the referee who had to make the decision. They now use it for goal validity, red cards, penalty kicks
                and offsides. The first use of VAR was during a friendly match between France and Italy.

				<strong>
					What problem does VAR solve?
				</strong>
			</p>
			<p>		
				The problem Video Assistant Referee solves is that there is fairplay whenever needed. If there is a doubt between both sides the referee can ask the Video Assistant Referee
				for help. This is a second opinion and will be always fair. The Video Assistant Referee is not one person looking on a screen but a whole team looking at what the camera saw.
				Because of the Video Assistant Referee there can be no doubt about a goal anymore.

				<strong>
					How does the VAR work?
				</strong>
			</p>
			<p>
				The referee pauzes the game and explains their decision and what they saw from their point of view. The Video Assistant Referee reviews the broadcast footage, using as many 
				angles as possible. Real-time replays will be used initially to check for intensity. Slow-motion replays will be used to identify the point of contact. If the VARâ€™s view does 
				not agree with what the referee believes they have seen then they can recommend an overturn.

					Who uses the VAR?
				</strong>
			</p>
			<p>
				The Video Assistant Referee is mostly used in big games with big clubs playing against eachother. This year nearly 60 leagues and a few other cup competitions use the Video 
				Assistant Referee. These include the Premier League, Bundesliga, Serie A, La Liga, Ligue 1, the FA Cup, Coppa Italia and many more. Also UEfA uses the Video Assistant Referee
				during their games. Even FIFA World Cup using the Video Assistant Referee.

				<strong>
					What can people expect from VAR?
				</strong>
			</p>
			<p>
				The Video Assistant Referee will help reduce the mistake which are made during a match by referee. This way a match will be better monitored and there will be a higher change of 
				fairplay. But it will take away the emotion of the game, it will be only counting on the decission the Video Assistant Referee makes and nothing else. The matches will be more and 
				more fair so everyone will have to except the decision of the VAR.

				<strong>
					The future of VAR
				</strong>
			</p>
			<p>
				For the future of Video Assistant Referee it is about advancing technologically as the referees expand their experience with this tool and try to reach a more complete use in search 
				of zero error in decision-making. They are working on version 2.0 in order to ensure that it does more and more justice. As FIFA previously reported, they are testing an innovation 
				in the offside system to make it automatic and more effective.
